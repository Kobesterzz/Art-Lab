          <p>Stage 1 - lights<br><br>   In the first part of shading you wanna start out with the light areas And work your way to the darks. You can start by going over some areas smoothly to show that those parts of the hand are a bit darker EX: parts of the hand facing away from the sun but still getting a bit of sunlight. <br><br>(You can see this in the Picture)
